##Quick Shell

Note: Currently in-progress. Not usable as a shell yet.

A [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)-compatible shell that Just-In-Time (JIT) compiles the shell commands.

Intended to be also usable as a library for auto-complete, refactoring, formatting, and general shell script introspection. Inspired by [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/). Licensed under the Apache License.
